Hey World!

I'm Dawid, a computer-science university student at the time im writing this, and i learned programming with java in school.
Language that intrest me are Java, Python, JavaScript and C++.
While im not very proficient in the later two, I'm capable of using and writing SQL and HTML.
Unfortunatly CSS is a skill that im currently lacking, but i may change that in the coming months.
I also learned about a lot of topics in computer-science within my time at the university TUM.
In addition to that i learned the basics of VHDL and Assembler, while i'm able to program inside Assembler.
I speak fluently German, English and Polish and I really enjoy the taste of peppermint tea... like i probably would drink about 20 liters of it in a day if ther werent any other easier to acces fluids to take in... guess that isnt normal huh :)... I mean as a fellow coder i should be coffe duh ... 0x539 for good measure and bb ^^
